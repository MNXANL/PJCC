# ＰＪＣＣ
(A [Strong PJCC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5oi2xMt18M&t=30s) clone)

This game has been developed and tested on GNU/Linux. I'm sure it will run on Windows/Mac but the instructions have been made for GNU/Linux computers.

### Controls
Use your keyboard arrows to move. As simple as that.

### To compile:
```
  make
```
You need to have installed SDL2 or the game won't compile!

### To run execute:
```
./PJCC 
```
And keep completing levels!

**Note: You can also use the precompiled binary in the repo in case you don't have (or want to have) SDL2 installed!**

### To do (in an uncertain future):
* Add some funky music (pls halp me)
