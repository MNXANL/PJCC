# ＰＪＣＣ
(A [Strong PJCC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5oi2xMt18M&t=30s) clone)


* To compile:
```
  make
```
You require to have installed SDL2 or the game won't work!

* To run execute:
```
./PJCC < Maps/StageN.txt
```
(Where N is a number between 1 and 4)

#To do (in an uncertain future):
* Add that funky music
* Autoload stages
* Make it more usable
